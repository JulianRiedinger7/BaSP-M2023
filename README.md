# Week 01

In this week i have worked alongside my team to create the screenflow of Mega Rocket SA gym in Figma. I worked mainly in the admin section.

# Week 02
In this week i used HTML and images from Figma to recreate the landing page of Mega Rocket SA. I also used Git and Github to upload the content. The next objective is to add styles to this web.

# Week 03

In this week i used CSS to style the landing page of the previous week. These are the features:

- The landing is made pixel perfect, which means that there is no responsiveness. 
- I mustn't use flexbox or grid.
- I used normalize.css to reset the css in each browser.
