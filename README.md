# Week 01

In this week i have worked alongside my team to create the screenflow of Mega Rocket SA gym in Figma. I worked mainly in the admin section.

# Week 02
In this week i used HTML and images from Figma to recreate the landing page of Mega Rocket SA. I also used Git and Github to upload the content. The next objective is to add styles to this web.
